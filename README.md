# 207-final-project

The datasets used in the project are included in the dataset.zip. 

The datasets downloaded from online sources are in the folder "source data". The income.xlsx contains the income level of countries obtained from The World Bank, where several country names are modified according to the WHO dataset. owid-covid-data.csv is downloaded from Our World in Data. vaccination-data.csv, WHO-COVID-19-global-data.csv and WHO-COVID-19-global-table-data.csv are downloaded from World Health Organization.

In the folder "merge data", all the extracted information used in the project is contained in merge_income.csv. For reproducing, you just need to read merge_income.csv(line 207 in my RMD) and run the chunks below. Please change the filepath in line 207 to your local filepath.
